# Command Line Workshop

This workshop teaches the basics of the bash shell.  Many of the commands are similar in other shell environments, but they aren't covered here.

# Software

On Mac OSX, which is based on a Unix environment, you can use the built in terminal program (found in the Utilities folder of the Applications folder).

Windows, which is not Unix based, does not come with a bash shell.  Please [install GitBash](https://workshops.rcs.northwestern.edu/install/bash/).

# Exercises

[DataCamp: Introduction to Shell for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science) is a free online interactive tutorial with exercises.  This is recommended for more practice and a review of material covered in the workshop (plus probably things we didn't get to).

[Exercises](/command_line_exercises.md) and [Exercise Solutions](/command_line_exercises_with_answers.md) are written specifically for a linux system (like Quest).  If you are working on a Mac or Windows computer, the exercises may not be relevant.
